learn how to use open cards

To study for finals with these flash cards:
  select all of the ppt slides after importing them into opencards
  use the "last minute" option on open cards
  select "limit the number of cards to be learned"
  set to 3
    this means that you learn 3 cards from one ppt, then move on to the next
    after you finish all the slides, it will bring you back to the menu
    just run it again, it will remember which 3 slides you've already learned
